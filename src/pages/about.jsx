          Welcome to my website! This project is built using React and showcases
          my ability to interact with the GitHub REST API. The main feature of
          this site is to find users on GitHub and display their profile data.
          You can search for any GitHub user and see their profile information,
          repositories, followers, and more.
        </p>
        <p>
          The idea behind this project is to provide a practical example of how
          to use React for front-end development and interact with external APIs
          to fetch and display data dynamically.
        </p>
        <p>
          I hope you find this project interesting and useful. Feel free to
          explore and try out the features!
